They notice how both the terrain and people have changed. At the border they are met by a welcoming committee.\n\nAlmost immediately they encounter the horrible roads they've been dreading. Claudio (the cameraman) falls first. Later Ewan admits to being scared about falling off and nervous about the bad roads.\n\nThe second greatest problem for Ewan and Charley are the constant police escorts: the last thing they want, they are quickly growing very tired of them.\n\nAnother welcoming committee which although the guys appreciate, they want to be unfettered in their journey.\n\nA light moment filming a herd of giant woolly camels quickly turns heavy. A very rattled looking Ewan and Charley tell how a man in a car just pointed a gun at them.\n\nAnother police escort takes the guys to a roadside turnout filled with more police cars and television cameras. Ewan is confused and upset.\n\nA policeman offers his house as a rest spot. Ewan is exhausted and happy to sleep on anything. Ewan and Charley see themselves on the local TV news and realise it's impossible to fully blend in. A light-hearted moment before bed ends a long and arduous day.\n\nAnother police escort delivers them into a full-blown media event. Charley voices how bad he feels for Ewan. They state they don't need any more police escorts.\n\nFree for the first time, Ewan and Charley drive to their first night camp. Ewan is giddy at the prospect while Charley is a reluctant camper. They wonder what else is to come.\n\nIn great spirits, Ewan and Charley have a great visit to a UNICEF project: a school with an indoor-climbing wall for kids.\n\nMore terrible roads: Ewan talks about wobbling all over and Charley, the experienced off-roader says they are the worst roads he's ever seen. On cue we see the guys struggling with their bikes in the sand.\n\nAt their second camp Ewan reveals a bug bite on his forehead and explains how being scared of failing on the bike has exhausted him. Ewan is very down. Charley shares some of the same concerns.\n\nEn route to the Aral Sea there is some respite in the form of tarmac. Ewan's forehead starts to swell in reaction to the bug bite. Bad luck strikes: Ewan gets petrol in his eyes again and in his ear. In his most revealing video diary we see his swollen face and frustration at having spent 15 minutes talking to his video camera with pause on.\n\nThe guys reach a beautiful 14th century mausoleum. Ewan can't recall all the details of its story and notes he is now just riding along and meeting the people he meets.\n\nAt a lavish luncheon for them - Ewan warns Charley that at these banquets horse penis is often served; lots of jokes follow about a suspect sausage. Ewan and Charley attend a 'goat polo' match and watch a traditional game of horseback kiss-chase. Ewan and Charley race each other on horseback.\n\nIn need of pampering, Ewan and Charley go to a traditional Kazakh spa (bathhouse). The massage they receive involves a brutal beating and rubdown, through which the guys moan and grunt their way.\n\nThe ever-present police are actually a help when they point out the road to a canyon the guys want see. The road back up out of it is almost impassable. After the canyon they bizarrely see piles of snow by the road despite the 105 degree temperature!\n\nEwan and Charley go to a gold mine, a site they always planned on visiting. In typical Charley fashion he nicks a piece of gold-filled rock. A quick montage reveals the guys arriving at the Singing Dunes. Met by another police escort, they are too tired to resist this time and follow them into town.\n\nAs it's their last night in Kazakhstan Ewan and Charley give in and enjoy a loosely organised show by local singers. They are invited home by a policeman and his wife and follow them back to their house. Ewan explains how he used to feel quite nervous but now it's quite normal to go back to strangers' houses for a meal and the possibility of staying the night. Confusion at the house; no-one knows what's going on. Exhausted and smelly the guys try out the banya (traditional sauna). Their hosts lay on an amazing spread of food and Ewan bravely samples the local speciality- boiled goat's head.\n\nIn diary camera bites, Ewan notes how beautiful the people of Kazakhstan are for wanting to know about them and wanting to share themselves with the guys. In a touching farewell moment, Ewan finally understands the police escorts cannot be blamed as they were only doing what they'd been told.\n\nAt a roadside caf\u00e9 Charley successfully orders their last Kazakh meal using a picture book of food. Ewan is very sad to leave this beautiful country but excited to get into Mongolia.

By AC196, the weapons used during the war had been abolished in the Earth Sphere. Nevertheless, as long as the human race exists, war and strife will never disappear completely...\n\nSally Po, now working for the Earth Sphere's peacekeeping forces known as the Preventers, discovered traces of Neo Titanium in space debris during her investigation. The costly alloy, developed by OZ scientists to counter the Gundams, was only used in the construction of space Mobile Suits.\n\nMeanwhile, Duo Maxwell and Quatre Raberba Winner were making preparations to launch their Gundams into the sun inside a depleted resource satellite ready for disposal. They felt that the Gundams were no longer needed in a peaceful world and would bring grave danger if fallen into the wrong hands. Both Heero Yuy and Trowa Barton had sent their Gundams to Quatre to dispose of as he saw fit, but Chang Wufei refused to do so.\n\nOn the resource satellite MO-II, the last battlefield of the Eve War, a party was held to commemorate the end of the war. As the President of the Earth Sphere United Nation made a speech on the meaning of their hard-won peace, Lucrezia Noin and Lady Une, both working for the Preventers, looked on.\n\nNoin contacted Sally, who told Noin of her discovery. A new type of Mobile Suits, which Sally referred to as the Thirteenth Constellation [1], was being secretly constructed.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Relena Darlian was paying a visit to the X18999 colony of L3. The local representatives claimed that it was the colony's wish to have a strong leader like her. Relena expressed disappointment that the representatives only seemed interested in the good of their own colony. She suddenly felt dizzy and before losing consciousness, she noticed the smiling faces of the representatives. Her tea had been drugged. A group of soldiers soon burst in to take her into custody.\n\nIn a darkened room, an old man and a young girl watched the President's speech with a an ominous smile.\n\nOn an L3 colony, a circus was showing a lively performance, but the audience was surprisingly small. When a group of men tried to attack Trowa Barton outside the circus tent, he discovered that these men were sent by Barton Consortium. He remembered his days spent in a secret base where he helped in the construction of Gundam Heavyarms as a technician. The real Trowa Barton, the chosen Gundam pilot whose identity he assumed, showed him a picture of his niece, Mariemaia. The man claimed that his niece would be the ruler of Earth once Operation Meteor was completed.\n\nHeero was checking for information on Mariemaia Barton at his computer when Duo appeared. As Heero prepared to leave for the L3 colony, he informed Duo that Relena had been abducted. Duo joked that Heero was infatuated with her.\n\nDekim Barton, head of the Barton Consortium, made a speech before Mariemaia's army. During the speech, he named Trowa a traitor who had infiltrated them. Trowa avoided Dekim's gunfire, jumped high into the air and landed before the old man. Before he could aim his gun at Dekim, Wufei stood between him and his target, and pointed his sword at him.\n\nNoin and Sally made their way towards the L3 colony. Sally remarked that either an independence declaration or a war declaration would be aired in a few hours, and that Relena had been abducted.\n\nRelena woke up in a luxuriously furnished room with a young girl. The girl, Mariemaia, calmly informed Relena that she was the one who ordered Relena's capture. She claimed to be the daughter of Treize Khushrenada, and made it clear that she intended to follow in her father's footsteps.\n\nHeero and Duo were trying to reach the L3 colony as well. Heero dreamt of his encounter with a little girl and her dog after he finished planting explosives in a Federation base. The mission was part of his training in preparation for Operation Meteor. The girl asked if he was lost, and he replied that he had been lost all his life. The girl gave him a flower to cheer him up before she left. He waited until it was night when he detonated the explosives. The base and the Mobile Suits inside were destroyed. However, one of the MS collapsed towards the residential area outside the base, causing a chain explosion. Heero watched helplessly as the place where the little girl lived was reduced to rubbles. Heero wondered throughout the ruins of the are where [2], he came across the remains of the girl's dog.\n\nLearning of Heero's reaction to the incident, Dekim Barton, the man behind Operation Meteor, ordered that Heero be trained out of his human feelings. Doctor J argued with Dekim without success, and reluctantly followed his order.\n\nDuo woke Heero and informed him that Mariemaia was on TV. As the girl declared war on the Earth Sphere United Nation, the President phoned Lady Une, making accusations before hanging up. As Lady Une considered her options, a man appeared in her office. It was Zechs Merquise, a.k.a. Milliardo Peacecraft, presumed dead in the Eve War.\n\nNoin and Sally detected a shuttle preparing to enter the defense line of the L3 colony. She warned the shuttle of the danger and was surprised to find Duo and Heero on it. Duo planned to cut straight through the defense line. The two Preventers decided to give them a hand in getting inside the colony.\n\nQuatre blamed himself for sending the Gundams into the sun. He and the Maganacs raced against time to retrieve the Gundams.\n\nHeero and Duo crash landed and captured two Mobile Suits. They intended to destroy as many MS as possible, then get inside the colony and act as they see fit.\n\nAs Duo proceeded towards the inner part of the colony, a new type of MS attacked him. From the pilot's fighting style, Duo figured out that his attacker was Trowa. Meanwhile, Heero was confronted by Wufei in his Nataku Gundam\n","rating":0,"duration":5160244,"view_count":1}},"index":0,"episode_sort_order":[1359]},"1308":{"key":1308,"title":"Season 1","num_episodes":49,"actual_episodes":49,"episodes":{"1309":{"key":1309,"title":"The Shooting Star She Saw","index":1,"summary":"In an effort to end many years of tyrannical rule, five pilots and their Gundams are dispatched to Earth to begin Operation Meteor.

A sheriff from out of town, Lee Nickel, is looking for a no limit game to join. He finds himself seated at the same table as the Matador, who tries to get inside his head and eventually takes all of his money with a winning hand. Seymour Annisman, the mastermind behind the trio's plan, reprimands Eddie and Clark for being seen together. They can't give anything up to the Matador because he owns Vegas.

Helping them are a team of Poles.\r\n\r\nAs the team's only 'country bumpkin' Hammond is the team leader. However, his garden plan fails to impress Clarkson and May, who want to include a water feature and a shed, respectively. They are sent to a Wyevale Garden Centre to pick up supplies, returning with their desired equipment.\r\n\r\nHammond uses a small digger to dig a trench, to be used to create a 'river of gravel.' Clarkson earlier revealed his unique method for pulling up weeds and cutting branches off trees using a shotgun. Hammond's digger topples over in the trench, so he returns with a much larger digger to pull it out, resulting in leaving numerous Caterpillar tracks marks all over the garden. Meanwhile, James and the Poles have completed the shed.\r\n\r\nHammond's tree seat is completed. He brings in a 14 tone crane to hook the seat so he could slip it over the tree. Despite the machine getting stuck, the crane is long enough to hook onto the seat. Because he had not got the hang of the crane, he accidentally swished it sideways, destroying both the shed and the seat.\r\n\r\nClarkson decides to remove a rockery by using a homemade bomb. During the explosion one wall of the shed James built is smashed. After this happens May steps out of the shed with a plank of wood, and asks what time the programme will air. After being informed it was going to air after the watershed, he exclaims 'you're a fu-'. At this point, the episode cuts to the next scene.\r\n\r\nJeremy orders some cement to pave over the garden, but he orders too little, and only a small portion of the garden is covered. Hammond gets stuck in the cement, and Jeremy lifts him out. James' shed is destroyed for the third time when Jeremy erects some rugby posts (despite the fact that none of Sir Stephen Redgrave's family plays rugby). However, he and the Poles accidentally drop the posts. This lead to James angrily telling Clarkson to apologize while pointing the plank of wood at Clarkson. Hammond reveals his barbecue system, which uses a jet engine to rotate the meat and cook it. However, the blades rotate too fast and the fire from the engine sets James' newly-rebuilt shed on fire. They would have been able to extinguish the fire if May and Clarkson hadn't fought over the fire extinguisher.\r\n\r\nThe team then received word that Sir Steve Redgrave was coming up the drive to the house. Redgrave is upset at the destruction of his garden, so the Poles run away. Eventually he comes around thanks to Jeremy talking to him privately. Jeremy then shows off his turbo-charged water feature, which blows the top off itself due to the water pressure and crashes into the greenhouse built by the Poles, breaking all the glass. Until then, the greenhouse was the only structure still intact.","rating":8.2,"duration":2761280,"view_count":3},"2818":{"key":2818,"title":"USA Road Trip","index":33,"summary":"Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May compare the Mercedes SLS, the Porsche 911 GT3 RS and the Ferrari 458 Italia in an epic road trip up America's east coast.

Even on the summit of this volcano, Brian would stand in the shade of the tallest mountain in the solar system, an extinct volcano on Mars called Olympus Mons, which rises up 27 km.\n\nYet the fifth wonder in the series isn't on a planet at all. It's on a tiny moon of Jupiter. The discoveries made on Io have been astonishing.

And it was all carved out in a geological heartbeat by a monumental flood.\n\nArmed with a gas mask, Brian enters a cave in Mexico where bacteria breathe toxic gas and leak concentrated acid. Yet relatives of these creatures could be surviving in newly-discovered caves on Mars.\n\nBut Brian's sixth wonder isn't a planet at all. Jupiter's moon Europa is a dazzling ball of ice etched with strange cracks. The patterns in the ice reveal that, far below, there is an ocean with more potentially life-giving water than all the oceans on Earth.\n\nOf all the wonders of the solar system forged by the laws of nature, there is one that stands out.

This orbit takes a staggering 250 million years to complete.\n\nUltimately, Brian discovers that time is not characterised by repetition but by irreversible change. From the relentless march of a glacier, to the decay of an old mining town, the ravaging effects of time are all around us. The vast universe is subject to these same laws of change. As we look out to the cosmos, we can see the story of its evolution unfold, from the death of the first stars to the birth of the youngest. This journey from birth to death will ultimately lead to the destruction not just of our planet, but also the entire universe, and with it the end of time itself.\n\nYet without this inevitable destruction, the universe would be without what is perhaps the greatest wonder of all; the brief moment in time in which life can exist.","rating":8.1,"duration":3543960,"view_count":2},"2336":{"key":2336,"title":"Stardust","index":2,"summary":"In this episode, Cox discusses the elements of which all living things, including humans, are made.

Starting with a zero gravity flight, Brian experiences the feeling of total weightlessness, and considers how much of an effect gravity has had on the world around us.\nBut gravity also acts over much greater distances. It is the great orchestrator of the cosmos. It dictates our orbit around the sun, our relationship with the other planets in our solar system, and even the way in which our solar system orbits our galaxy.\nYet the paradox of gravity is that it is actually a relatively weak force. Brian takes a face distorting trip in a centrifuge to explain how it is that gravity achieves its great power, before looking at the role it plays in one of the most extraordinary phenomena in the universe - a neutron star. Although it is just a few kilometres across, it is so dense that its gravity is 100, 000 million times as strong as on Earth.\nOver the centuries our quest to understand gravity has allowed us to understand some of the true wonders of the universe, and Brian reveals that it is scientists' continuing search for answers that inspires his own sense of wonder.","rating":8.4,"duration":3527920,"view_count":2},"2338":{"key":2338,"title":"Messengers","index":4,"summary":"In the last episode of Professor Brian Cox's epic journey across the universe, he travels from the fossils of the Burgess Shale to the sands of the oldest desert in the world to show how light holds the key to our understanding of the whole universe, including our own deepest origins.\n\nTo understand how light holds the key to the story of the universe, you first have to understand its peculiar properties. Brian considers how the properties of light that lend colour to desert sands and the spectrum of a rainbow can lead to profound insights into the history and evolution of our universe.\n\nFinally, with some of the world's most fascinating fossils in hand, Brian considers how but for an apparently obscure moment in the early evolutionary history of life, all the secrets of light may have remained hidden. Because although the universe is bathed in light that carries extraordinary amounts of information about where we come from, it would have remained invisible without a crucial evolutionary development that allowed us to see.
